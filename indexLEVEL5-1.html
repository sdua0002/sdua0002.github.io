       <span id="l3">with many schools understanding the potentials,</span>
      
       <span id="l4">opportunities, and obligations of design,</span>
       <span id="l5">while others continue to teach students how to churn out pretty pieces of garbage</span>
       <span id="l6">Institutions that stress sustainability, social responsibility, </span>
       <span id="l7">cultural adaptation, ethnography, and systems thinking </span>
       <span id="l8">are leading the way.</span>
       <span id="l9">But soon they will come to define what industrial design means.</span>
       <span id="l10">(A relief to those constantly trying to define the discipline today!)</span>
