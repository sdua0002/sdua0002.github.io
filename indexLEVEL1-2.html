Teach Sustainability Early. 
      <br>
      <br>
    
      
Design education is at a crossroads,
      <br>
      <br>
      
with many schools understanding the potentials, 
      <br>
      <br>
      
opportunities, and obligations of design,while others 
      <br>
      <br>
     
      
 continue to teach students how to churn out pretty pieces of garbage. 
      <br>
      <br>
      
Institutions that stress sustainability, social responsibility,
      <br>
      <br>

cultural adaptation, ethnography, and systems thinking 
         <br>
      <br>
are leading the way. But soon they will come to

      <br>
      <br>
 define what industrial design means.
      <br>
      <br>
(A relief to those constantly 
      <br>
      
      trying to define the discipline today!) 
      <p>This doesn’t mean no aesthetics. It just means a keener eye on costs and benefits.</p>
